# Stock Valuation & 5-Year Projection App

This Streamlit app provides an interactive tool for evaluating stocks and projecting their price over the next five years based on EPS (Earnings Per Share) growth and P/E ratio assumptions. You can input stock tickers and customize key financial metrics to project future stock prices and calculate a target entry price for a desired return.

## Features
- **Stock Data**: Fetches the current stock price, EPS (TTM), P/E ratio, and EPS growth rate from Yahoo Finance.
- **5-Year Projection**: Calculates the stock price projection over the next five years based on inputted assumptions for EPS growth and P/E ratio.
- **Entry Price Calculation**: Determines the target entry price to achieve a specified return on investment.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can adjust inputs via the sidebar to see the effects on projected stock prices and entry price.

## How It Works

1. **Stock Selection**: 
   - Enter a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL for Apple) to retrieve the current data for the selected company.
   
2. **Input Assumptions**: 
   - Customize assumptions for **EPS (TTM)**, **EPS Growth Rate**, **P/E Ratio**, and **Desired Return**. The app uses these inputs to project future stock prices.

3. **Results**:
   - The app will display the **Entry Price for a 15% Return**, along with a **5-Year Stock Price Projection**.

4. **Graph**:
   - A line chart shows the projected stock prices over the next five years.

## Installation

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have `requirements.txt`, you can install the necessary packages manually:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit yfinance plotly numpy pandas
   ```

3. Run the app:
   
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- **Streamlit**: Web framework for creating interactive apps.
- **yfinance**: Fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **plotly**: Used for creating interactive visualizations (line chart).
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and projections.
- **pandas**: For handling and manipulating data.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter the stock ticker of the company you want to analyze.
3. Customize the assumptions in the sidebar for EPS, EPS growth rate, P/E ratio, and desired return.
4. The app will display:
   - The entry price needed for a specified return.
   - A graph of projected stock prices for the next five years.

## Example

If you input "AAPL" as the stock ticker, the app will fetch data for Apple Inc. and display the following:
- Current stock price
- EPS (TTM)
- P/E Ratio
- EPS Growth Rate
- A projection of the stock price over the next 5 years
